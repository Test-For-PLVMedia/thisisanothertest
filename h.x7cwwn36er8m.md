The Room (401)
==============

Organizational Layout
---------------------

The “root” of the room starts at Hoch’s desk. Then, going clockwise around the room and starting at A, drawers are lettered. Any time there is more than one drawer stacked on top of one another, they are labeled A1, A2, etc.

Where is everything‽
