Social Media
============

For the academy, social media is one of the most important tools. For starters, it is our main advertising platform. We are able to advertise future events and games that PLVMedia will be either recording or streaming. We use platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and even Instagram.

We donâ€™t stream any events on instagram, however, it is still VERY important. Almost every student in highschool has an instagram account so advertising on instagram is one of our largest advertisers. Not only do people follow PLVMedia, but many academy members as well as students share when we make a post for an upcoming event/stream.
